**Last Updated:** September 6, 2025  

*Unofficial Alexa Skill for YNAB* is an Alexa skill that integrates with the You Need a Budget (YNAB) API to provide users with information about their personal budgets. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and how it is protected.  

## 1. Information We Collect
- **YNAB Account Information**: When you link your YNAB account, we receive an OAuth access token from YNAB that allows the skill to access your budget data.  
- **Budget Data**: We may request information such as category names, balances, and budgeted amounts from your YNAB account in order to respond to your Alexa requests.  
- **Alexa User ID**: We receive a unique identifier from Alexa for each user to associate requests with your linked YNAB account.  

## 2. How We Use the Information
- We use your YNAB data **only to respond to the specific questions you ask Alexa** (e.g., "How much can I spend on groceries this month?").  
- We do not use your budget data for analytics, advertising, or any other purpose.  

## 3. Data Storage
- OAuth tokens may be stored securely in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to maintain your connection to YNAB.  
- Budget data retrieved from YNAB is processed in real time and is **not permanently stored**.  

## 4. Data Sharing
- We do not sell, rent, or share your personal or budget data with third parties.  
- Data may be shared with YNAB through their API as part of the normal functioning of the skill.  

## 5. Security
- All communication with YNAB and Alexa uses HTTPS encryption.  
- Tokens and any temporary data are stored securely within AWS services provided by Amazon.  

## 6. Your Choices
- You may unlink your YNAB account at any time through the Alexa app.  
- You may disable the skill at any time, which will remove access to your YNAB data.
